## Self-Care Center 

## Abstract:

I built an app that gives the user a randomized positive message- either an affirmation or mantra. The user can select which they would like to see, and delete any messages they don't like.


## Installation Instructions:

They can clone it from GitHub or use the deployed website

### Context:

This is the second project for Mod 1. It is the first project in the mod where we write our own HTML and CSS from scratch.

## Learning Goals:

As a repeater, I did a similar project in the past. It was my goal to make my code cleaner than last time and get more practice with flexboxes 

### Wins + Challenges:

Constructing the HTML and CSS felt smoother this time around, and I feel like I have utilized pseudocode much more than in the past. I did struggle with the delete button function, but by pseudocoding the logic out first it was much easier to parse together my ideas into something functional.
